Previous history - Applicants who have repayed their previous debts should have higher chances.
Loan Amount - If the amount is less, there is higher chance of approval.
Loan term - Loan for less time period and less amount should have higher chances of approval
Credit History - Applicants with god credit history will have great chances of approval
EMI - Lesser amount to be paid each month will have higher chances.
